# Heart Disease Prediction App
![Project Screenshot](./heartApp.png)

This project is an application for predicting heart disease using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). It is built with Streamlit for the user interface and hosted on the Streamlit platform.

## Project Overview

- Predicted heart disease using various machine learning algorithms:
  - Logistic Regression (LR)
  -

- Notable result:
  - Without feature selection, using the entire dataset, the ANN model achieved a similar test accuracy of around 98.56%.


## Dataset

The dataset used for this project can be found on Kaggle at the following link:
